    Module that extracts the last timestep from a sequence.

    This layer is used to summarize sequence outputs from recurrent

    Parameters
    ----------
    None

    Input
    -----
    x : torch.Tensor
        Input tensor of shape (B, L, D), where

    Returns
    -------
    out : torch.Tensor
        Output tensor of shape (B, D), corresponding to the last timestep
        of each sequence in the batch.

"""
Explaination:
The TakeLastTimeStep layer transforms an input tensor of shape (B, L, D) 
into an output tensor of shape (B, D) by indexing the last position.
The hidden state at position L has been updated by all L previous inputs
and by the time model reaches position L-1, which is the last time step, 
the state has came across and collected information from all inputs u(0) 
through u(L-1) and therefore the (B, D) tensor at the final position
serves as a compressed summary of the entire (B, L, D) sequence.
This is identical to how RNNs, LSTMs, and GRUs use their final hidden state
for classification tasks — the last timestep naturally accumulates the 
history of the whole sequence through the recurrent processes.
